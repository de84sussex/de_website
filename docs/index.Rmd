## Overview

Knowing *what* you know: Analysing your data with Danielle Evans 

Conducting your analyses can often feel very overwhelming - trying to figure out where to start can make you feel like you have no idea what you're doing, which can lead to procrastination and stress. This workshop intends to help you avoid getting stuck, and instead, help you get stuck in to your analyses by serving as a reminder of the huge range of analytical skills you have developed throughout your degree, and how you can put them into practice.  

To get the most out of this session, it would be useful (*but not required*) for you to attend/review Dr Mankin's [Planning your Analyses](LINK) session, have created an analysis plan, or know what analysis you intend to do, prior to this workshop.
